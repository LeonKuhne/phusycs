- allow drag on orbiting particles to adjust orbit radius & angle
- add mobile friendly controls (similar to vr, eg swipe to speed up, slow down)
- add timescale to view (put dropdown on timeline)
- buffer clips like normal to allow longer playback
- change timeline to slider and allow adjusting playhead
- export audio
- test lazy loading particle.at to improve speed, alt consider refactoring draw particle mechanism
